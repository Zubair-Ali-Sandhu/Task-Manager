🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Task Manager Android App! 📱

I built a full-featured task management application from scratch using Java and Android Studio. Here's what it does:

✅ Create and organize tasks with priorities (Low to Critical)
⏰ Smart notifications that remind you about upcoming deadlines
📅 Set due dates and times for every task
💪 Daily motivational quotes to keep you productive
🔔 Full-screen alarms for critical tasks - you won't miss them!
🌙 Runs in the background and even restarts after phone reboot

What I learned while building this:

🔹 Android app development with Java
🔹 SQLite database for storing tasks
🔹 Background services and notifications
🔹 Material Design UI/UX principles
🔹 Fragment-based architecture
🔹 API integration for real-time data
🔹 File handling and permissions management

The app uses a clean layered architecture with Repository pattern, making it maintainable and scalable. I organized the code into 9 different packages (activities, fragments, database, services, etc.) following Android best practices.

This project really challenged me to understand how different Android components work together - from the UI layer to background services to database management.

Building this app was an amazing learning experience! 💡

📱 Just finished building a Task Manager app for Android!

Created a complete task management solution using Java that includes:
• Task creation with priority levels
• Smart deadline notifications
• Background service that runs 24/7
• Daily motivational quotes
• Full-screen alarms for critical tasks

🛠️ Tech Stack Breakdown:
✓ SQLite + ContentProvider → Secure data storage
✓ Fragment + RecyclerView → Smooth UI with Material Design
✓ Services + AlarmManager → 24/7 background notifications
✓ BroadcastReceivers → Boot recovery & alarm triggers
✓ REST API → Daily motivational content
✓ Repository Pattern → Clean, maintainable architecture

Organized into 9 packages (activities, fragments, database, services, etc.) following Android best practices.

This project taught me how all Android components work together seamlessly! 💡

Proud of how this turned out! 🚀
